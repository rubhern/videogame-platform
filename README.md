# VideoGame Platform

VideoGame Platform is a product initiative for discovering, tracking, and rating
video games. **The product alignment phase is closed.** Its approved first journey
is captured in the [learning MVP story map](docs/product/mvp-story-map.md), and its
[mobile-first clickable prototype](docs/product/clickable-prototype.md) completed an
owner-accepted [simulated five-session round](docs/research/simulated-round-synthesis.md).
The focused simulated regression resolved the blocking issue and left the journey
decision at `PASS`.

The [minimum provider-independent domain model](docs/architecture/domain/mvp-domain-model.md)
is approved. The current focus is defining its API contract for one vertical slice.
No production architecture, framework, database, deployment model, public release,
or business model has been approved.

## Start here

1. Read the [Product Brief](docs/product/product-brief.md) as the closed product
   alignment record.
2. Use the [learning MVP story map](docs/product/mvp-story-map.md) for the current
   journey, release cut, acceptance checks, and deferred scope.
3. Open the [clickable prototype](docs/product/clickable-prototype.md) and use the
   [accepted simulated round](docs/research/simulated-round-synthesis.md) as the
   closed journey decision record.
4. Use the [approved domain model](docs/architecture/domain/mvp-domain-model.md) for
   the minimum provider-independent contract.
5. Review the [assumptions](docs/product/assumptions.md).
6. Review the resolved decisions and reopening conditions in
   [open questions](docs/product/open-questions.md).
7. Use the [glossary](docs/product/glossary.md) to keep terminology consistent.
8. Review the [Codex workspace setup](docs/development/codex-setup.md).

## Validation

```bash
bash scripts/validate-docs.sh
./mvnw -f tools/igdb-poc/pom.xml clean verify
```

The Maven command requires JDK 21 and tests the isolated IGDB PoC only with
local fixtures. It does not require provider credentials or call IGDB.

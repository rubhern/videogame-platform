# Private dev runtime and deployment

This directory is the reviewed operator entry point for the owner-managed private
`dev` host (`vgpdev`). The
[platform and delivery design](../../docs/architecture/deployment/mvp-platform-and-delivery.md)
owns the policy; the files here own the executable details; the
[operations runbook](../../docs/development/operations-runbook.md) records which
procedures have been proven on the host, their evidence boundary, and day-two
operations (synchronization on `dev`, incident handling).

## Boundaries

- `compose.yaml` defines digest-pinned PostgreSQL, a locally optimized Keycloak image
  built from a digest-pinned upstream, the bounded OpenTelemetry collector, the
  digest-selected application, a one-shot migration actor and a one-shot browser
  smoke runner. Only PostgreSQL, Keycloak and telemetry start without an explicit
  profile or service selection; the application runtime receives `videogame_app`
  credentials and cannot migrate, and the migration actor receives only
  `videogame_app_migrator` credentials on the internal data network.
- `bin/deploy-private-dev` runs only when the owner invokes it on a host named
  `vgpdev`, rejects tags and other mutable references, holds one host lock, and
  requires both an immutable GHCR digest and the full source revision expected to
  have produced it. The prior application is untouched until the migration actor
  succeeds; every readiness and smoke check is tied to the newly created container.
- Deployment evidence is an atomically updated JSON record outside the checkout
  (timestamps, target, initiator, source revision, image, application and migration
  versions, candidate container ID, completed smoke checks, phase, outcome), with no
  credentials or personal data.

## Host foundation

These are rebuild instructions for the owner-managed host, not an installation log.
Record outcomes and exceptions in the issue that tracks the host; keep addressing and
credentials private.

1. Review existing data with the owner before erasing the target SSD. Check disk
   identity/SMART health, then clean-install Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS `amd64` with
   OpenSSH and a non-root sudo user; apply package updates and prefer local SSD boot
   in firmware.
2. Allocate the SSD to the root filesystem. If the installer leaves free LVM extents
   (`lsblk -f`, `sudo lvs`, `sudo vgs`), extend the root LV with
   `sudo lvextend -r -l +100%FREE <root-lv>` and verify with `df -h /`.
3. Connect Ethernet with a router DHCP reservation. Install the owner's SSH public
   key, verify a second session, then disable password/root login. Install
   [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/docs/install/linux) on the host and on Windows
   (not WSL), enroll both in the owner-only tailnet and verify SSH through it. Confirm
   router forwarding/UPnP is off and that administrative access is unreachable from
   outside the tailnet/LAN over IPv4 and IPv6.
4. Keep a closed laptop lid running: a `/etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/` drop-in with
   `HandleLidSwitch=ignore`, `HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=ignore`,
   `HandleLidSwitchDocked=ignore`, `IdleAction=ignore`, and
   `sudo systemctl mask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target`.
   Reboot and test closed-lid access. Record firmware power-restoration support
   instead of assuming recovery after power loss.
5. Install Docker Engine and the Compose plugin from the
   [official apt repository](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), then
   `sudo systemctl enable --now docker tailscaled`. After a reboot check
   `systemctl is-active docker tailscaled`, `sudo docker info` and
   `sudo docker compose version`. Do not start the repository stack yet.
6. Install `smartmontools` and `lm-sensors`; record OS/architecture, `free -h`,
   `lsblk`, LVM state, SMART health and `sensors`, and inspect `systemctl --failed`
   and `journalctl -b -p err`. A single idle snapshot does not prove workload
   capacity.

## One-time private host preparation

Do not run these commands from a workstation and do not apply them to `vgpdev`
without the owner's explicit host-change decision. Replace `<operator>` and
`<checkout>` only after verifying them on the host. The host needs Bash, Python 3,
Docker Engine and the Compose plugin; deployment smoke JavaScript runs inside the
dedicated Playwright container, so Node.js is not a host prerequisite.

1. Create the protected runtime configuration and secret files. The protected parent
   directory is the host access boundary; Compose grants containers only the files
   each actor needs.

   ```bash
   sudo groupadd --system --gid 20001 vgp-runtime
   sudo usermod --append --groups vgp-runtime <operator>
   sudo install -d -m 0750 -o root -g vgp-runtime /etc/videogame-platform/dev
   sudo install -m 0640 -o root -g vgp-runtime \
     <checkout>/deploy/private-dev/runtime.env.example \
     /etc/videogame-platform/dev/runtime.env
   sudo <checkout>/deploy/private-dev/bin/prepare-secrets \
     /etc/videogame-platform/dev/secrets vgp-runtime
   sudo install -d -m 0770 -o root -g vgp-runtime \
     /var/lib/videogame-platform/dev/deployment-evidence
   ```

   Start a new login session so group membership applies. Set
   `PRIVATE_DEV_SECRETS_GID` from the real group and replace both example origins with
   the exact `vgpdev` MagicDNS HTTPS origins. Leave the application/source/version
   placeholders unchanged: the deployment command overrides them for one invocation.
   Populate IGDB credentials only for an explicitly initiated catalogue sync. The
   preparation command creates a fixed non-personal smoke username and random password
   in `oidc-smoke-username` and `oidc-smoke-password`; neither value is printed or
   placed in `runtime.env`.

2. Validate the reviewed topology without starting or replacing services, and run
   the independent telemetry receipt check (a disposable collector plus one fixed,
   non-personal OTLP sender; no application is deployed):

   ```bash
   bash scripts/validate-private-dev-runtime.sh \
     --env-file /etc/videogame-platform/dev/runtime.env
   bash scripts/validate-private-dev-runtime.sh --telemetry-smoke
   ```

   The application placeholders are accepted only by the static validator; the
   deployment command rejects them.

3. Start only the runtime dependencies. Do not enable the application or deployment
   profiles here.

   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file /etc/videogame-platform/dev/runtime.env \
     --file deploy/private-dev/compose.yaml pull postgres telemetry
   docker compose --env-file /etc/videogame-platform/dev/runtime.env \
     --file deploy/private-dev/compose.yaml build --pull keycloak
   docker compose --env-file /etc/videogame-platform/dev/runtime.env \
     --file deploy/private-dev/compose.yaml up --detach postgres keycloak telemetry
   ```

4. Keep Tailscale Funnel and router forwarding disabled. Confirm the owner-only
   tailnet policy before configuring the two private HTTPS routes:

   ```bash
   tailscale serve --bg --https=443 http://127.0.0.1:8080
   tailscale serve --bg --https=8443 http://127.0.0.1:8180
   tailscale serve status
   tailscale funnel status
   ```

   Verify the Keycloak discovery issuer through port `8443`, database/role ownership,
   restart persistence, loopback-only listeners, router forwarding/UPnP state and
   unsolicited public IPv4/IPv6 reachability. None of those checks is implied by
   repository validation.

5. After Keycloak and its private HTTPS route are healthy, provision the dedicated
   deployment-smoke account from the protected files:

   ```bash
   deploy/private-dev/bin/provision-oidc-smoke-user \
     --env-file /etc/videogame-platform/dev/runtime.env
   ```

   The command is idempotent: it declares the admin-only marker in the realm User
   Profile when missing, then creates the marked, enabled account when absent or
   rotates its protected password. It refuses an unmarked existing username, any
   profile other than its fixed synthetic values, direct client roles, or group
   membership, and never places a password or token in arguments, environment
   metadata, logs, realm imports, or Git. If an earlier attempt left an unmarked
   `vgp-deployment-smoke` account, confirm through the private Admin Console that it
   is the failed non-personal account, delete that one account, and rerun the command;
   never add the marker to adopt it.

## Owner-triggered deployment

Choose a trusted `main` source revision and review its successful required checks,
image publication summary, scan/SBOM evidence and immutable digest. Both selected
values stay explicit in the command:

```bash
deploy/private-dev/bin/deploy-private-dev \
  --env-file /etc/videogame-platform/dev/runtime.env \
  --image ghcr.io/rubhern/videogame-platform@sha256:<approved-64-hex-digest> \
  --source-revision <approved-full-40-character-main-sha> \
  --initiator rubhern
```

Under one non-blocking host lock the command:

1. validates that the target is `vgpdev`, the protected runtime configuration
   renders, smoke credentials exist, dependencies are healthy, and evidence storage
   is writable;
2. resolves the supplied revision's GHCR tag for verification only, requires its
   published digest to equal the supplied digest, pulls by digest, and verifies the
   image's source, revision and version OCI labels;
3. builds the digest-pinned, no-retry Playwright smoke runner before changing the
   database or application;
4. runs the selected image once as `videogame_app_migrator`, applies and validates
   only packaged production Flyway migrations, and stops immediately on failure;
5. force-recreates only the application service with the selected digest, waits for
   candidate health, and verifies the created container uses the inspected image;
6. runs the deployment smoke against that candidate and the private HTTPS boundary,
   then verifies structured correlation/trace evidence and collector receipt;
7. finalizes the JSON evidence record as `success`, or as `failure` with the phase
   that stopped. A failed outcome is never changed to success because another
   container or older version answers health checks.

The smoke checks management liveness/readiness; `/actuator/info` version and source
revision; the HTTP/JVM/JDBC metric catalogue; `GET /api/v1/releases` returning a
valid local page (including zero items) or the approved `CATALOGUE_NOT_READY`
response; the matching Spanish shell rendering in Chromium with IGDB hosts blocked;
real Keycloak authorization with an opaque `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax` BFF
session, no browser-stored OAuth material, and CSRF-protected logout; W3C
trace/correlation propagation in structured logs; and trace receipt by the collector.
It deliberately does not rate a game, traverse every screen, or run provider
synchronization, and it is not product acceptance.

## Backup, restore, rollback and host-loss recovery

These are the owner-triggered recovery controls. Repository validation
(`scripts/test-private-dev-backup-recovery.sh`) proves only the encryption,
integrity, retention and decision logic; every step that reads the live database or
a real host is environment evidence recorded in the runbook.

### State model

The irreplaceable durable state is the two PostgreSQL databases: `videogame_platform`
(application state and product-owned curation) and `videogame_keycloak` (identity
configuration and runtime accounts such as the deployment-smoke user). Both are
captured as logical `pg_dump` custom-format artifacts. Catalogue/provider data is
reconstructable by IGDB synchronization. Roles and passwords are **not** backed up:
`docker/postgres/init` bootstraps them from the protected secret files when a clean
data volume initializes, which is why a backup never stores a credential.

### One-time backup key setup

Generate the backup keypair on a trusted machine that is not the host, keep the
private key and passphrase offline, and import only the public key on `vgpdev`, so
host compromise cannot expose backup contents. `<recipient>` is the key's email or
fingerprint.

```bash
# On the offline owner machine (once): create the keypair and export the public key.
gpg --full-generate-key
gpg --armor --export <recipient> > vgp-backup-public.asc

# On vgpdev (once): import only the public key into a dedicated keyring.
install -d -m 0700 /etc/videogame-platform/dev/backup-gnupg
gpg --homedir /etc/videogame-platform/dev/backup-gnupg --import vgp-backup-public.asc
```

### Encrypted backup with integrity and retention

Runs on `vgpdev` while the dependency stack is healthy. It dumps both databases,
encrypts each to the public key, writes a manifest and `SHA256SUMS`, self-verifies,
and prunes older backups to the retention count. Copying the destination off the host
(for example over Tailscale with `rsync`) is the owner action that makes the backup
"outside the host".

```bash
deploy/private-dev/bin/backup-private-dev \
  --env-file /etc/videogame-platform/dev/runtime.env \
  --gnupg-home /etc/videogame-platform/dev/backup-gnupg \
  --recipient <recipient> \
  --destination /mnt/vgp-backups \
  --initiator rubhern \
  --keep 7
```

Integrity and retention are re-checkable anywhere, without Docker or the private key:

```bash
deploy/private-dev/bin/verify-private-dev-backup --backup /mnt/vgp-backups/<backup-id>
deploy/private-dev/bin/verify-private-dev-backup --backups-root /mnt/vgp-backups --expect-at-least 7
```

### Isolated restore

Restores a verified backup into a **distinct** Compose project, never the live one.
It rebuilds a clean database volume (destroying only that isolated project's
volumes), bootstraps roles from the protected secret files, streams each decrypted
dump into `pg_restore`, and verifies the restored schema, catalogue tables and
Keycloak realm/account counts. It requires the private key in `--gnupg-home` and
explicit destructive confirmation.

```bash
deploy/private-dev/bin/restore-private-dev \
  --backup /mnt/vgp-backups/<backup-id> \
  --env-file /etc/videogame-platform/dev/runtime.env \
  --gnupg-home /etc/videogame-platform/dev/restore-gnupg \
  --isolated-project vgp-restore-rehearsal \
  --confirm-destroy-isolated-target \
  --evidence-directory /var/lib/videogame-platform/dev/deployment-evidence
```

Tear the rehearsal down afterwards with
`docker compose ... --project-name vgp-restore-rehearsal down --volumes`.

### Rollback versus forward fix

Before recovering a bad deployment, decide whether an older image is still
schema-compatible. The assessment compares the applied Flyway version with the
candidate's packaged migration version and enforces that an applied migration is
never reverted.

```bash
deploy/private-dev/bin/assess-recovery-strategy \
  --env-file /etc/videogame-platform/dev/runtime.env \
  --target-migration-version <candidate-image-flyway-version> \
  --target-image ghcr.io/rubhern/videogame-platform@sha256:<digest>
```

`ROLLBACK` redeploys the older digest with the normal deployment command (its
migration step finds nothing to apply). `FORWARD_FIX` means building and deploying a
corrected revision. `REFUSE` means the inputs are inconsistent; do nothing until they
are explained.

### Host-loss recovery

Recovery does not depend on the original hardware; any compatible Linux host is
sufficient:

1. Rebuild the host foundation and run the one-time preparation above.
2. Restore the latest verified backup with `restore-private-dev`, naming the live
   project as the isolated project on the fresh host (there is no other stack to
   protect), or a rehearsal project first to validate the backup.
3. Deploy the last-good image digest with `deploy-private-dev` and confirm the smoke
   and readiness checks pass.
4. Record the recovery decision, backup id, image digest, migration version and
   outcomes from the generated evidence records.

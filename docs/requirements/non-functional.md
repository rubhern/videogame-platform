### Non-Functional (MVP-level)
* **Performance:** API P99 < 300 ms, homepage P95 FCP < 2 s on 3G.
* **Security:** OWASP Top-10 mitigations, HTTPS-only, CSP headers.
* **Compliance:** GDPR ‚Äì deletion & export endpoints in backlog.
* **Availability:** 99.5 % monthly SLO for public endpoints.
* **Observability:** trace > 90 % sampled in staging, 10 % in prod; custom metrics for rating submissions & searches.


## üîíüìà Non-Functional Requirements ‚Äì Detailed Explanation

| NFR | What the target means in practice | Why it matters for a videogame catalogue | How we‚Äôll measure & enforce it |
|-----|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Performance**<br>‚Ä¢ **API P99 < 300 ms**<br>‚Ä¢ **Homepage FCP < 2 s on 3 G** | *API P99* ‚áí 99 % of backend requests (GET /search, POST /rating ‚Ä¶) must finish < 300 ms **inside the pod**, CDN latency excluded.<br>*FCP (First Contentful Paint)* is a Core Web Vital; the first text/image on `/` must appear within 2 s on a 1.6 Mbps (Fast 3 G) simulation. | Discovery must feel instant. Slow pages drop engagement; every +100 ms can cut conversions. | ‚Ä¢ **k6**/Gatling load test in CI.<br>‚Ä¢ Prometheus histogram `http_request_duration_seconds{quantile="0.99"}`.<br>‚Ä¢ Lighthouse-CI budget fails if FCP > 2 s. |
| **Security**<br>‚Ä¢ OWASP Top-10 mitigations<br>‚Ä¢ HTTPS-only<br>‚Ä¢ CSP headers | Protect against injection, XSS, broken auth, etc. All traffic via TLS 1.3 with HSTS. `Content-Security-Policy` blocks inline scripts & mixed content. | Ratings/reviews are user-generated; an XSS could deface pages or steal tokens. HTTPS secures logins on public Wi-Fi. | ‚Ä¢ Nightly **OWASP ZAP** scan; high-sev findings block release.<br>‚Ä¢ ALB forces 443; port 80 ‚Üí 301.<br>‚Ä¢ Helmet middleware sets CSP, X-Frame-Options; Snyk/Dependabot keep deps patched. |
| **Compliance**<br>‚Ä¢ GDPR Right-to-Be-Forgotten & export endpoints (backlog) | Data model & APIs must let us delete **all** personal data (ratings, reviews, tokens) or export it (JSON/CSV). Self-service UI can wait, but backend hooks must exist. | EU users may sign up day 1; retrofitting GDPR later is expensive and risky. | ‚Ä¢ Unit tests assert `DELETE /user/{id}` cascades.<br>‚Ä¢ Tables/indices tag columns with `pii=true` for future automation. |
| **Availability**<br>‚Ä¢ 99 .5 % SLO / month | ‚â§ 3 h 40 m total downtime per month, including planned maint in business hours. Multi-AZ but not multi-region. | MVP tolerates short night outages but must be ‚Äúup most of the time‚Äù to collect feedback. | ‚Ä¢ Uptime ping ‚Üí Grafana SLO dashboard.<br>‚Ä¢ Post-mortem if error-budget burn > 50 %. |
| **Observability**<br>‚Ä¢ ‚â• 90 % traces sampled in staging, 10 % in prod<br>‚Ä¢ Business metrics for ratings & searches | *Tracing*: every request in staging; 10 % in prod to manage cost.<br>*Metrics*: `ratings.count`, `reviews.count`, `search.latency`, `rating.avg`. | Debugging distributed flows + measuring feature uptake (e.g., Twitch promo spike) requires traces & dashboards. | ‚Ä¢ OpenTelemetry SDK ‚Üí Jaeger (staging) / Tempo (prod).<br>‚Ä¢ Loki logs correlated by `trace_id`.<br>‚Ä¢ Prometheus alerts on metric anomalies. |

### Architectural implications

* **Performance** ‚Üí CDN, Redis edge cache, Brotli, async DB writes.
* **Security** ‚Üí OAuth/OIDC provider, mTLS in service mesh, Trivy scans in CI.
* **Availability** ‚Üí stateless pods across 3 AZs, RDS Multi-AZ or DynamoDB global tables.
* **Observability** ‚Üí OTel starter wired into every Spring Boot service from Sprint 0.
* **Compliance** ‚Üí All tables include `user_id`; prefer soft-delete + TTL for cheap RTBF.

Embedding these NFRs from the start keeps the MVP small **and** production-ready, avoiding costly rewrites later.
